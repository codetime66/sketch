The examples in these directories are arranged in the following way:

package
  |
  +--class
       |
       +--CLASS EXAMPLE
       |
       +--method
            |
            +--METHOD EXAMPLE


For example, to find the class example for the Array class,
go to the directory:
    
    lang.reflect/Array

To find the method example for BigInteger.compareTo(), go to the
directory:

    math/BigInteger/compareTo


In these directories you will find the example source code, compiled
class files, and any necessary supporting files.  You can run most
examples with the command:

    java Main

Some examples require an input file or output file. Usually a usage
line is printed to indicate how to run it. In a few instance, you need
to look at the source to see what parameters the program expects.

Note that not all examples in the book are included in these
directories.  In particular, we've only included examples that are
complete programs.  Examples that are code fragments have not been
included.
